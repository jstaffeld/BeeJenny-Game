# BeeJenny-Game
A simple game based on a <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/">tutorial</a>. I will eventually recreate this with my own assets.

A working Codepen pen of version [alpha 2.0] is here: <a href="http://codepen.io/jstaffeld/pen/jEKQKQ">http://codepen.io/jstaffeld/pen/jEKQKQ</a>

My projects home for this game is here: <a href="http://jeremystaffeld.com/projects/beejenny/">http://jeremystaffeld.com/projects/beejenny/</a>
